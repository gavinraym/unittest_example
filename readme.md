> # Python Unittest Example

#### Two files are needed for a unittest.

* The module unit being tested, which in this example is the Unit class from module.py.
* The testing script that runs Unittest, which I have named test.py.

#### To run the unittest:

Run test.py as is. Results are printed in the terminal, and are read from the bottom up. The first line you read should say:

>> FAILED (failures=3)
>>

Try uncommenting lines from the files to decrease the number of failures. When the readout simple says:

>> OK
>>

Then you know you have a Unit that passes all the tests.
